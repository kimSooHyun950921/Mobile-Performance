We need passionate researchers.

This is research topic in Data Network Laboratory at Chungnam National University.

Basically, this project performs fuzzing tests on mobile applications at the user device level.

This is different from analysis at the source code level or binary level and has advantages and disadvantages.

Most typically, we can consider the environment of the user's device (performance, heat, conflict with other applications, etc.).
